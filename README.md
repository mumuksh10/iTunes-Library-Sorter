# iTunes-Library-Sorter
Developed a software which takes your iTunes music library in a ‘.xml’ file and sorts your library by Album, Artist, Genre and Track. It also shows every particular track's length and the amount of times the user has listened to a particular track/song.

Hoe to use the software -:
1) Run the tracks.py file and it will ask you to enter your iTunes .xml file.
2) You can extract your iTunes .xml file by following this -> **Select the playlist in the sidebar on the left, choose File > Library > Export Playlist, then choose XML from the Format pop-up menu**
3) After entering your .xml file a sqlite database will be generated with your sorted data. (Like the one in MyData folder)

You can use the .xml file in MyData folder as a sample file
